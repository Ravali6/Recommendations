# Movie Recommendation system
Recommendation engines that run on collaborative filtering recommend each item (products advertised on your site) based on user actions. The more user actions an item has, the easier it is to tell which user would be interested in it and what other items are similar to it. As time progresses, the system will be able to give more and more accurate recommendations.

Visitor cold start

The user or visitor cold start simply means that a recommendation engine meets a new visitor for the first time. because there is no user history about her, the system doesnâ€™t know the personal preferences of the user. Getting to know your visitors is crucial in creating a great user experience for them.
